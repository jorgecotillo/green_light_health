# Github repository:

All design ideas, development decisions and product vision (milestones, releases), will happen in github.

# Near Vision of Product (iteration one):

Green Light Health App will serve businesses and consumers to prevent the spread of illnesses. It will provide a health declaration to end-user consumers which, upon completion, businesses can use to verify their risk level before allowing them into their locations. The app will use forms of consumer contact tracing to supplement the health declarations when they may be exposed to a pathogen before showing signs of illness. 

The development team's infrastructure will include scripted environment creation, automated testing, continuous integration, and continous delivery for all components. This will expedite the delivery rate of product increments and increase the efficiency of the development team to help further this product's cause.

# Detailed Personas:
Chris J  
Boston, MA  
Age 25  
An avid music fan since a young age, Chris has been starved for live music since the onset of the pandemic in mid-March.
As a regular concert goer who enjoys all types of music, his favorite band the Red Hot Chili Peppers were due to perform
at the 2020 Boston Calling music festival. Sadly, the event was postponed until further notice due to the global pandemic. As Red
Hot Chili Peppers begin to plan their return to the Boston area next Summer, they will require attendees to download and install
the Green Light Health app in order to confirm the health status of all concert guests. As the event approaches, Chris will
need to use the Green Light Health web app and complete his health declaration so that he can attend the event and see his beloved
Red Hot Chili Peppers.

James H  
Boston, MA  
Age 46  
James owns and operates "Ride The Lightning", a live music venue in Kenmore Square directly adjacent to Fenway Park.
Due to the pandemic, James was forced to close his business until further notice, causing his entire revenue stream to dry up. However,
as time went on and confirmed coronavirus cases began to drop off in Massachusetts, he began to envision how to reopen his club safely
and begin welcoming back his customers. He recently learned of the Green Light Health app and has determined that it will be required for
all guests to download the app and show the green check to a club security guard in order to access the venue. As a promoter,
James needs the ability to create a business account for his venue and determine the specific health requirements that he will enforce
in order to allow his customers access to the club. James needs this app to be accurate as possible, he cannot risk having an outbreak
occur at his club because he does not believe the club will financially survive another shut down.

Sarah A  
Seattle WA  
Age 34  
Sarah is a Software Engineer at Amazon and she's been working from home since the pandemic hit the US. The primary school
where her two kids go to is closed. She is getting exhausted because she is working full time while also being a mom and
a teacher full time. She wants to be able to send her kids back to school and herself back to the office. But she knows
that won't happen unless the spread of the virus is under control. She heard of Green Light Health web app that will help her community
track and respond to any local outbreaks and she wants to do her part by signing up to the app and accurately filling out
the health declaration daily - whether she or her young children have any symptoms, or if they tested positive or
negative. She also wants to easily check the latest risk level assessment of local establishments before patronizing
them. In addition, she wants to be sure her family's personal and health data is secure.

Jason S  
Bellevue WA  
Age 20  
Jason is a student at Bellevue College. Since the pandemic hit the US, his social life has shrunk and as a very
extroverted person, he's been having a hard time with the isolation. Now that some public spaces and businesses are
starting to open, he has been wanting to go out to eat and shop. However, most businesses are using the Green
Light Health web app and requiring customers to declare their symptoms before they can be allowed to enter. Out
of frustration, Jason has signed up for the app and he just wants to spend as less time as
possible reading and filling out the health declaration forms. Because he doesn't want to be prevented entry, he just
wants to fill the declaration always as having no symptoms, whether that's true or not.

John Doe
Seattle, WA
Age 30
John is a seasoned Developer, he worked as a full stack engineer at a large social media company. He got a CS degree at Harvard and
moved to Seattle two years ago. He comes from a family full of doctors, so is natural for him to have a passion for computers and health. John lived for one year in Quito, Ecuador helping people that live far away from the city, where health providers don't usually get to. He'll be leading the Development Team and with his natural passion for computers and health plus his exposure to health needs, makes him an excellent team member.

Emily Hood
Washington DC
Age 45
Emily works at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a Director of the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Her vast knowledge is key to this product. Due to her role, her time is limited to just one hour per week at maximum. Emily has a Software Engineer certificate from Harvard Extension and truly believes that computers and well defined algorithms helps prevent spreading disease.
Emily will be asked for feedback and guidance for items such as: Government Health Regulations, Product feedback and probably early adopters of the Product MVP.
