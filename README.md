# Github repository:

All design ideas, development decisions and product vision (milestones, releases), will happen in github.

# Near Vision of Product (iteration one):

Green Light Health App will serve businesses and consumers to prevent the spread of illnesses. It will provide a health declaration to end-user consumers which, upon completion, businesses can use to verify their risk level before allowing them into their locations. The app will use forms of consumer contact tracing to supplement the health declarations when they may be exposed to a pathogen before showing signs of illness. 

The development team's infrastructure will include scripted environment creation, automated testing, continuous integration, and continous delivery for all components. This will expedite the delivery rate of product increments and increase the efficiency of the development team to help further this product's cause.

# Far Vision of Product:

Green Light Health App helps businesses prevent the spread of illness in their locations. The app will use health declarations and contact tracing to keep consumers and businesses informed when they are potentially at risk for the spread of pathogens. Businesses will be able to provide required custom declarations to consumers before allowing them into their locations. Businesses will know if a potential consumer looking to enter is at risk due to showing symptoms of illness or having recently been in contact with someone who is. Consumers will know the risk of visiting various business locations based on the tracing of other consumers through their area. Consumers will be notified if they have potentially been exposed to a pathogen so they can shelter in place to protect others. The system will benefit both businesses and consumers to create a safer world.

# Detailed Personas:
David Eilers, MD (Real Person)
Saint Paul, MN
Age 51
Dr. Eilers specializes in Ophthalmology. He has over 23 years of experience in the medical field. He owns and manages a clinic and is an experienced business owner. He needs to keep treating patients for essential care during the pandemic, but also wants to ensure his employees and patients are safe. He would like an efficient way of checking in patients while keeping everyone involved as safe as possible.

Denise Fung (Real Person)
Age 28
Denise Fung is a data analyst working in San Francisco, CA. She has been working from home since the pandemic started and her company is unlikely to return to the office until late this year. She wants to prevent the spread of illness and protect others, but needs to leave home for essentials. She wants an easy way to know if she has potentially been in contact with someone who is ill even if she is not showing symptoms herself so that she can stay home and protect others. She will avoid contact with others if there is a contact tracing mechanism in place to inform her that she is a potential carrier.

Chris J  
Boston, MA  
Age 25  
An avid music fan since a young age, Chris has been starved for live music since the onset of the pandemic in mid-March.
As a regular concert goer who enjoys all types of music, his favorite band the Red Hot Chili Peppers were due to perform
at the 2020 Boston Calling music festival. Sadly, the event was postponed until further notice due to the global pandemic. As Red
Hot Chili Peppers begin to plan their return to the Boston area next Summer, they will require attendees to download and install
the Green Light Health app in order to confirm the health status of all concert guests. As the event approaches, Chris will
need to use the Green Light Health web app and complete his health declaration so that he can attend the event and see his beloved
Red Hot Chili Peppers.

James H  
Boston, MA  
Age 46  
James owns and operates "Ride The Lightning", a live music venue in Kenmore Square directly adjacent to Fenway Park.
Due to the pandemic, James was forced to close his business until further notice, causing his entire revenue stream to dry up. However,
as time went on and confirmed coronavirus cases began to drop off in Massachusetts, he began to envision how to reopen his club safely
and begin welcoming back his customers. He recently learned of the Green Light Health app and has determined that it will be required for
all guests to download the app and show the green check to a club security guard in order to access the venue. As a promoter,
James needs the ability to create a business account for his venue and determine the specific health requirements that he will enforce
in order to allow his customers access to the club. James needs this app to be accurate as possible, he cannot risk having an outbreak
occur at his club because he does not believe the club will financially survive another shut down.

Sarah A  
Seattle WA  
Age 34  
Sarah is a Software Engineer at Amazon and she's been working from home since the pandemic hit the US. The primary school
where her two kids go to is closed. She is getting exhausted because she is working full time while also being a mom and
a teacher full time. She wants to be able to send her kids back to school and herself back to the office. But she knows
that won't happen unless the spread of the virus is under control. She heard of Green Light Health web app that will help her community
track and respond to any local outbreaks and she wants to do her part by signing up to the app and accurately filling out
the health declaration daily - whether she or her young children have any symptoms, or if they tested positive or
negative. She also wants to easily check the latest risk level assessment of local establishments before patronizing
them. In addition, she wants to be sure her family's personal and health data is secure.

Jason S  
Bellevue WA  
Age 20  
Jason is a student at Bellevue College. Since the pandemic hit the US, his social life has shrunk and as a very
extroverted person, he's been having a hard time with the isolation. Now that some public spaces and businesses are
starting to open, he has been wanting to go out to eat and shop. However, most businesses are using the Green
Light Health web app and requiring customers to declare their symptoms before they can be allowed to enter. Out
of frustration, Jason has signed up for the app and he just wants to spend as less time as
possible reading and filling out the health declaration forms. Because he doesn't want to be prevented entry, he just
wants to fill the declaration always as having no symptoms, whether that's true or not.

Emily Hood
Washington DC
Age 45
Emily works at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a Director of the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Her vast knowledge is key to this product. Due to her role, her time is limited to just one hour per week at maximum. Emily has a Software Engineer certificate from Harvard Extension and truly believes that computers and well defined algorithms helps prevent spreading disease.
Emily will be asked for feedback and guidance for items such as: Government Health Regulations, Product feedback and probably early adopters of the Product MVP.

# Product Backlog:
Find the [Product Backlog](https://github.com/jorgecotillo/green_light_health/projects/1)
under github projects.

The product backlog has been ordered by the value added to the user as well as by the user story dependencies (when applicable). The aim is to delivery the highest value user stories first. When a user story is dependent on another user story (often because the latter story would be too large on its own) the aim is to deliver them sequentially when they are the highest value stories on the product backlog.

The initial estimation of the product backlog was conducted by the whole team on June 29, 2020 using an all-at-once affinity estimation technique.

# Definition of Ready:
Our D.O.R. requires that the team be able to determine "what needs to be done" and the "amount of work" required to complete a given story.
The below checklist should be complete to ensure a story is ready.
- [ ] The user story has a title which the team can use to refer to the vertical slice.
- [ ] The user story has an excellent opening sentence of the form "As a [role], I want [X] so that [Y]".
- [ ] The user story details capture and describe a reasonable unit of work which the development can understand.
- [ ] The user story has been estimated by the team in story points.
- [ ] The user story description contains clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] The user story is in line with the Product Vision
- [ ] All blockers and dependencies for the needed implementation are resolved

# Project Part 2: Sprint 1
> You have a forecast of how many story points your team can complete during the sprint. The forecast is documented in your README.
#### Forecasted Story Points:
5

> The rationale for your forecast is documented in your README.
#### Rationale for this Forecast:
The rationale for this forecast is based on the team's availability over the next 4 days and is largely an educated 
guess due to the fact that our team has only recently come together. The team does not yet have an example of 'yesterday's weather'.
The first story we intend to complete will allow a user to read and accept a health declaration in order to enter
a concert venue, gym, or restaurant. This initial prototype will be available in some form as a usable web UI.

> You pulled stories into your sprint backlog. You pulled stories from the top of your product backlog. The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed your forecast. Only Development Team members participated in this activity.
#### Sprint 1 Backlog:
(insert screenshot here)

> All of the stories in your sprint backlog have size less than half your forecast velocity. If you noticed PBIs that are too large to get done in a sprint, you refined them by splitting them into smaller stories and estimating the smaller stories.
#### TODO: Need more stories?

> You decomposed stories into tasks. The tasks are clearly listed in your sprint backlog.
#### TODO: Link to sprint backlog

> Your sprint backlog, including both stories and tasks, is represented in a kanban board. The kanban board, or a URL of the kanban board, is documented in your README. Richard can view the kanban board.
#### TODO: Link to sprint backlog

> You have a sprint burndown chart. On the x-axis, you display time markers in units of 1 day. On the y-axis, you display story points remaining to get done. There is a linear curve descending from left to right; the leftmost point of the curve is number of story points in your sprint at sprint day 1; the rightmost point is 0 story points remaining on the last day of the sprint. The burndown chart, or the URL of the burndown chart, is document in your README. Richard can view the burndown chart.
#### TODO (Brendan): Link to burndown

> You have conducted multiple Daily Scrums. You have evidence of at least one daily scrum documented in your README. 
#### TODO: Screenshot evidence of Daily Scrum from Sprint 1

> What did you do in the last 24 hours that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? Annotate your team's response so it's clear which team members did which activities.

> What will you do in the next 24 hours to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? Annotate your team's response so it's clear which team members plan to do which activities. 

> Do you see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? What are the impediments? What is your impediment removal plan?

#### TODO: Sprint backlog task board and burndown (mid-sprint)

> There is evidence that you paired or mobbed on your code. The evidence could be a photo or video of your team working together, or it could be some other kind of evidence. The evidence is included in your README.
#### TODO: Evidence of pair/mob programming involving all members

> There is evidence that you are building your product test-first. (Fall semester only: There is at least 1 BDD / A-TDD test in your test suite, and it passes - 1 point.) There are at least 10 unit tests in your test suite, and they all pass.
#### TODO: BDD Test, Unit Tests in repo, build as evidence

> Your team conducts a Sprint Review.
#### TODO: Screenshot of Sprint Review meeting

> Your product increment is working software.
#### TODO: Videocast of Greenlight in action

> At least one stakeholder attends your sprint review, and you provide evidence that your stakeholder was there. You revise your product backlog based on the feedback you receive.
#### TODO: Screenshot of sprint review including stakeholder
