# Detailed Personas:
Chris J  
Boston, MA  
Age 25  
An avid music fan since a young age, Chris has been starved for live music since the onset of the pandemic in mid-March.
As a regular concert goer who enjoys all types of music, his favorite band the Red Hot Chili Peppers were due to perform
at the 2020 Boston Calling music festival. Sadly, the event was postponed until further notice due to the global pandemic. As Red
Hot Chili Peppers begin to plan their return to the Boston area next Summer, they will require attendees to download and install
the Green Light Health app in order to confirm the health status of all concert guests. As the event approaches, Chris will
need to use the Green Light Health web app and complete his health declaration so that he can attend the event and see his beloved
Red Hot Chili Peppers.

James H  
Boston, MA  
Age 46  
James owns and operates "Ride The Lightning", a live music venue in Kenmore Square directly adjacent to Fenway Park.
Due to the pandemic, James was forced to close his business until further notice, causing his entire revenue stream to dry up. However,
as time went on and confirmed coronavirus cases began to drop off in Massachusetts, he began to envision how to reopen his club safely
and begin welcoming back his customers. He recently learned of the Green Light Health app and has determined that it will be required for
all guests to download the app and show the green check to a club security guard in order to access the venue. As a promoter,
James needs the ability to create a business account for his venue and determine the specific health requirements that he will enforce
in order to allow his customers access to the club. James needs this app to be accurate as possible, he cannot risk having an outbreak
occur at his club because he does not believe the club will financially survive another shut down.
